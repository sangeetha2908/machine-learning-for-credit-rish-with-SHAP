# Credit Risk Analysis, Prediction & Explainability
 A machine learning project for predicting credit risk with interpretability and explainability using SHAP analysis.
---

##  Project Overview

This project builds a credit risk prediction model using machine learning to classify loan applicants as defaulters or non-defaulters. The model is interpreted using SHAP to explain predictions.And explain the drivers of credit risk, these findings in terms of potential policy adjustments for a lending institutions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains loan applicant information with features such as:
- **Personal details** (Age, Income, Employment Length)
- **Loan details** (Amount, Interest Rate, Grade, Intent)
- **Credit history** (Default on File, Credit History Length)
- **Credit history** (Default on File, Credit History Length) Loan status (0 = No Default, 1 = Default)

 **Dataset Source**: Public credit risk datasets from **Kaggle / Lending Club / Home Credit**.

## Data Analysis
We conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset structure and detect any inconsistencies.

###  Steps in Data Analysis
1. **Missing Value Handling**
- Filled missing values for `person_emp_length` with **median**.
- Replaced missing values for `loan_int_rate with` **mean**.

2. **Outlier Removal**
- Removed **age > 80** (unrealistic for loan applicants).
- Removed **employment length > 60** (not practical).

3. **Feature Engineering**
- **Loan-to-Income Ratio** = `loan_amnt / person_income`
- **Loan-to-Employment Length Ratio** = `person_emp_length / loan_amnt`
- **Interest Rate-to-Loan Ratio** = `loan_int_rate / loan_amnt`

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance default & non-default cases.

##  Model Training
To ensure **robust performance** , we trained model and analysis it.

###  Models Used
- **XGBoost**
- **Random Forest**

### Evaluation Metrics
- **AUC Score**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**

##  Interpretability
This project uses **SHAP** for:

###  Global Interpretability
- Top 10 most important features
- SHAP Summary plot
- Feature importance SHAP plot

###  Local Interpretability

- Borderline correct prediction
- Five credit risk applicants

##  How to Run the Project

### Option 1 — Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Upload the dataset and notebook  
2. Install packages using `requirements.txt`  
3. Run cells from top to bottom  

### Option 2 — Local Machine
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook project.ipynb
```

##  Key Insights
- **Loan-to-Income Ratio** is the most significant factor in predicting default risk.  
- **Longer credit history** reduces the probability of default.  
- **Higher interest rates** increase the risk of default.  
- **Loan intent (purpose of the loan)** plays a crucial role in classification.
